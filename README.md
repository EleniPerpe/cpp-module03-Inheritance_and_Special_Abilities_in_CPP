This repository focuses on a set of exercises in C++ that explore inheritance, polymorphism, and class design. The exercises involve implementing a series of robot characters, each with unique attributes and abilities, while demonstrating important C++ concepts like constructors, destructors, member functions, and class inheritance.

The project simulates a family of robots (ClapTrap, ScavTrap, and FragTrap), where each robot is a specialized version of the base class ClapTrap, demonstrating inheritance and how derived classes can customize behavior while retaining base class functionality.
